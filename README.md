# AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

The "AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures" project is a machine learning-based application that enables users to control their computer mouse using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the application recognizes hand gestures and translates them into mouse movements. It employs deep learning models to accurately predict hand movements and provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

This project is designed to work on any computer with a camera, making it accessible for anyone interested in exploring computer vision and machine learning capabilities. The code is available on GitHub, making it open-source and available for community contributions.
